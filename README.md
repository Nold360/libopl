# libOPL - Poor-Python OPL-Manager & Library
This Repository containes the code for "popl". Popl is a simple Python implementation
of the "OPL Manager". While popl is the cli frontend, it's sub-classes can also
be used as a library to parse the "ul.cfg", split games to ul-format, download artwork, fix filenames, etc.

## Features
 - Add game images (iso's) to OPL-Drive 
   - Split them to UL-Format if needed/wanted
 - Read, write & merge ul.cfg
 - Download artwork for all games on drive from open API
 - List all games on a OPL-Drive
 - init OPL-Drive with all needed folders
 - Fix game names & artwork for all games on drive


## ToDo / Limitations / Known Bugs:
 - Fix "fix" function - lol
 - Lots of cleanup & error handling
 - Very buggy, alpha state code by a bad non-coder
 - Currently only available for Linux (port yourself)
